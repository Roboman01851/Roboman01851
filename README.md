## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Refining my C/C++/Python skills 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python/C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I took classes on Electronics/Electrical Engineering for 7 years and my first Programming language is C.
- ðŸ˜Ž I love to challenge myself with hard projects.

I am REALLY into programming and electronics and I love making practical projects that can be useful in daily life or just for fun.
