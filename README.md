## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Refining my C/C++/Python skills 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/C++
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took classes on Electronics/Electrical Engineering for 7 years and my first Programming language is C. 

I am REALLY into prgramming and electronics and I love making practical projects that can be useful in daily life or just for fun.
